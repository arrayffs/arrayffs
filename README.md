 I am a begginer game hacker who got into this stuff around 3 years back, it all started on Linux with the cheat called AimTux, then in december of 2022 i moved on to Windows because of Linux just not suiting my needs anymore, i still to this day enjoy more legit cheating over hvh, tho csgo has been getting boring in the past few months and i am probably going to move on to a different game very soon, all depends on how cs2 will be entertaining ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
